# 0x04. Files manager

This project is a summary of our back-end trimester as ALX Software Engineering students: authentication, NodeJS, MongoDB, Redis, pagination and background processing.

## Objectives
The objective is to build a simple platform to upload and view files:

- User authentication via a token
- List all files
- Upload a new file
- Change permission of a file
- View a file
- Generate thumbnails for images

Of course, this kind of service already exists in the real life - itâ€™s a learning purpose to assemble each piece and build a full product.
